## Visual Resume

Here is my visual resume, built entirely from scratch in R!

```{r, out.width = "900px", echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("media/PhillipsInfographicResume.jpg")
```

You can create your own visual resume using the [visual resume Shiny app](https://ndphillips.shinyapps.io/Visual_Resume/). I plan to release the code as an R package shortly.
