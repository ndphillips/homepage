## Unconscious decision making (?)

## Wisdom of crowds within one mind: "Inner Crowd"

How can people make better judgments and decisions? One way is to combine estimates from a large group of diverse people. We know from extensive research that the average judgment from a crowd can be incredibly accurate -- even more so than the most accurate individual person. This phenomenon is known as the *wisdom of crowds* [@surowiecki2005wisdom]. However, relying on a crowd is not very practical in most real world decisions as it would require people to take a massive survey every time they want to make a decision. But can a person benefit from a wisdom of crowds within one mind -- an "inner-crowd"? Indeed, recent research has shown they can [@vul2008measuring;@herzog2009wisdom].

In *Improving Bayesian reasoning with the inner-crowd* [@phillips2016bayesian] we explore how people can use an inner-crowd to improve judgments in Bayesian reasoning tasks. 

In *Utilizing confidence in the inner-crowd* [@phillips2016confidence], we explore how people can and should use confidence to boost the benefits of their inner-crowd:

## Fast and frugal decision trees
