#### Education

My educational background is in mathematical statistics and experimental psychology with an emphasis on cognition and decision-making. I obtained a B.A. in Mathematics from Grinnell College, a M.S. in Experimental Psychology from Ohio University, and a PhD in Experimental Psychology from the University of Basel.

#### Research Philosophy

I am a cognitive scientist interested in decisions under uncertainty, with a focus on information search, impression formation, and decision making. I am passionate about R, open science, reproducible research, and Bayesian statistical methods.

#### Publications

I have published research on unconscious decision making and decision making under competition. I am also self-publishing an introductory e-book on R titled [YaRrr! The Pirate's Guide to R](piratesguide.html). For more information about my past, and future publications, view my [CV](cv.html).

#### Presentations 

I have given several talks and workshops on decision making and R at international societies such as the Society for Judgment and Decision Making, the Society for Mathematical Psychology, and the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. I am available for future talks or workshops by <a href="mailto:nathaniel.d.phillips.is@gmail.com" target="_top">request</a>.

#### Teaching

I have tought courses and supervised theses in judgment and decision making, research design, statistics, and R programming at universities such as the University of Basel and University of Konstanz.
