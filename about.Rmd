#### Education

My educational background is in mathematical statistics and experimental psychology with an emphasis on cognition and decision-making. I obtained a B.A. in Mathematics from [Grinnell College](http://www.grinnell.edu), an M.S. in Experimental Psychology from [Ohio University](http://www.ohio.edu), and a PhD in Experimental Psychology from the [University of Basel](http://www.unibas.ch).

#### Philosophy

I am a cognitive scientist interested in decisions under uncertainty, with a focus on information search, impression formation, and decision making. I am passionate about R, open science, reproducible research, and Bayesian statistical methods. For more information about my beliefs in open science, view one of my blog posts **coming...**

#### Publications

I have published research on unconscious decision making and decision making under competition. For more information about my past, and future publications, view my Publications page **coming...**

#### Presentations 

I have given several talks and workshops on decision making and R at international societies such as the [Society for Judgment and Decision Making](www.sjdm.org) and the [Society for Mathematical Psychology](www.mathpsych.org), the [Max Planck Institute for Human Development](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en) and I am available for future talks or workshops by <a href="mailto:nathaniel.d.phillips.is@gmail.com" target="_top">request</a>.

#### Teaching

I have tought courses and supervised theses in judgment and decision making, research design, statistics, and R programming at universities such as the [University of Basel](www.unibas.ch) and [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/).
