You have reached the personal webpage of Nathaniel Phillips. If you're looking to learn about my approach to statistical programming with R, decision making research, and open science, you're in the right place!

I am a currently post-doctoral researcher in the department of [Economic Psychology](https://psycho.unibas.ch/en/centers/abteilung-details/home/abteilung/economic-psychology/) at the University of Basel. Here are links (updated October, 2017) for my <a href="media/Phillips_Resume_Oct2017.pdf#" class="download" title="Download resume as PDF (Updated October, 2017)">Resume</a> and  <a href="media/Phillips_CV_Oct2017.pdf#" class="download" title="Download CV as PDF (Updated October, 2017)">CV</a>.

### October 2017

- [Presentation: INFORMS 2017](https://ndphillips.github.io/Informs2017/#1). On 24 October I had the pleasure of chairing a session titled [Simplicity versus Complexity in forecasting and prediction](http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4471/session/963) at the 2017 INFORMS operations research conference in Houston TX. This was really an amazing session as I was joined by a fantastic team of reseachers: [Florian Artinger](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/en/staff/florian-artinger) from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and Simply Rational, [Dan Goldstein](http://www.dangoldstein.com/) from Microsoft Research and former president of the Society for Judgment and Decision Making and [Pantelis Pipergias-Analytis](http://infosci.cornell.edu/forward-thinking-people/research-staff/pantelis-pipergias-analytis) from Cornell. Funnily enough, 3 of the 4 of us independently presented simulation results comparing the accuracy of simple to complex algorithms using datasets from the UCI machine learning inventory (If that's not convergent validity for a method then I don't know what is!). You can view the abstracts from our session [here](http://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/4471/session/963), and the slides to my talk on creating fast-and-frugal trees with my FFTrees R package [here](https://ndphillips.github.io/Informs2017/#1).

### September 2017

- [First BaselRBootcamp](www.therbootcamp.com): Over the course of two weekends (9, 10, 16, 17) in September, Dr. Dirk Wulff and I hosted our first BaselRBootcamp, a 4 day intensive R course. We had 11 bootcampers coming from both academia and industry, one of whom came all the way from Chile! The bootcamp was a huge success and we look forward hosting the next bootcamp in January of 2018. Registration will be available soon at http://www.therbootcamp.com.


### August 2017

- [12 August Blog Post](https://ndphillips.github.io/blog/simplicity-matters-3-updates-to-the-fftrees-universe/): New blog post on three updates to the FFTrees universe [Simplicity matters - 3 updates to the FFTrees universe](https://ndphillips.github.io/blog/simplicity-matters-3-updates-to-the-fftrees-universe/)

- [ShinyFFTrees Link](https://econpsychbasel.shinyapps.io/shinyfftrees/): I am happy to announce a Shiny version of FFTrees called [ShinyFFTrees](https://econpsychbasel.shinyapps.io/shinyfftrees/). ShinyFFTrees allows you to use almost all of the functionality of the FFTrees package entirely in a web-browser. You can even upload and model your own data.

- [FFTrees JDM Publication](http://journal.sjdm.org/17/17217/jdm17217.pdf). Our FFTrees manuscript titled *FFTrees: A toolbox to create, visualize, and evaluate fast-and-frugal decision trees* is live at the Society for Judgment and Decision Making Journal webpage.



### July 2017

- In September I will be co-organizing an intensive 4 day workshop on R called *The R Bootcamp* in Basel with my long-time colleague [Dr. Dirk Wulff](https://dwulff.github.io/). The purpose of the course is to give people with little to no R experience all the tools they need to start their R journey. Cost and registration information is available at our website [www.rbootcamp.com](https://therbootcamp.github.io/)

- This week at the [useR!](https://user2017.brussels/) conference in Brussels I will be giving a talk on my package FFTrees that makes it easy for anyone to create, visualize and evaluate fast-and-frugal decision trees. Check out [this link](https://user2017.sched.com/event/AxqK/fftrees-an-r-package-to-create-visualise-and-use-fast-and-frugal-decision-trees) to see the abstract and the [video link](https://channel9.msdn.com/events/useR-international-R-User-conferences/useR-International-R-User-2017-Conference/FFTrees-An-R-package-to-create-visualise-and-use-fast-and-frugal-decision-trees?term=fftrees) to see the full presentation.

- I am happy to announce that our paper titled *FFTrees: A toolbox to create, visualize, and evaluate fast-and-frugal decision trees* has been accepted and is currently in press at the journal of [Judgment and Decision Making](http://www.sjdm.org/journal)! I will post a link to the final draft of the paper as soon as it is available (probably in mid-July).
