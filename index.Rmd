## Latest News!

### July

- In September I will be co-organizing an intensive 4 day workshop on R called *The R Bootcamp* in Basel with my long-time colleague [Dr. Dirk Wulff](https://dwulff.github.io/). The purpose of the course is to give people with little to no R experience all the tools they need to start their R journey. Cost and registration information is available at our website [www.rbootcamp.com](https://therbootcamp.github.io/)

- This week at the [useR!](https://user2017.brussels/) conference in Brussels I will be giving a talk on my package FFTrees that makes it easy for anyone to create, visualize and evaluate fast-and-frugal decision trees. Check out [this link](https://user2017.sched.com/event/AxqK/fftrees-an-r-package-to-create-visualise-and-use-fast-and-frugal-decision-trees) to see the abstract and [look here](https://ndphillips.github.io/useR2017_pres/) to see the full presentation.

- I am happy to announce that our paper titled *FFTrees: A toolbox to create, visualize, and evaluate fast-and-frugal decision trees* has been accepted and is currently in press at the journal of [Judgment and Decision Making](http://www.sjdm.org/journal)! I will post a link to the final draft of the paper as soon as it is available (probably in mid-July).
